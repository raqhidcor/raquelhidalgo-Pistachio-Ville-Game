Pistachio Ville is my first complete deployed project at Ironhack's Web Development bootcamp. I've used Canvas for the game, Vainilla JS for DOM manipulation and CSS3 for the styling. 

In the game you have to help our character Pistachio Cookie to collect all the pistachios and you score for each one of them but she is allergic to peanuts so we careful and avoid them because if you catch one peanut, GAME OVER.

Pistachio Ville is a game to have fun playing quick matches trying to beat your own record or competing with someone to see who scores the most points. Go try it and have fun!


## Instructions 

Move left and rigth to collect the pistachios and score points. 

## Try it yourself! :computer:
